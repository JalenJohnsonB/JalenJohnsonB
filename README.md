## Welcome!
Hello! My name is Jalen and I'm studying Computer Science at Princeton University. Welcome to my github page, hopefully you can find something that you like.
Please feel free to connect if you take an interest in any of my projects, or want to start something completely new! I'm super passionate about language learning, art, and video games, 
so most of my projects will be related to that. Let's try to make a positive impact with our code!

## Contacts
